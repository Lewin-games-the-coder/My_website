				<p class="ioio">In modern politics, and history, a parliament is a legislative body of government. Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. <img class="cant" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTEJSWxMUVQTqB-6vL4rlPaG1tl2GzSFqPwvkc3jvdKA&s"><br><centre><h1 class="ed">Parliament of Kenya</h1></centre></p><p>The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies. Some contexts restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems (e.g., the Parliament of Kenya), even where it is not in the official name. </p><p class="sra">Historically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies. What is considered to be the first modern parliament, was the Cortes of LeÃ³n, held in the Kingdom of LeÃ³n in 1188. According to the UNESCO, the Decreta of Leon of 1188 is the oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system. In addition, UNESCO granted the 1188 Cortes of Alfonso IX the title of "Memory of the World" and the city of Leon has been recognized as the "Cradle of Parliamentarism".</p>

					<h2>Meaning of AI</h2><BR>
					<p class="ioio">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. <img class="cant2" src="download (2).jpeg"> AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>
					<h2> Evolution of AI</h2>
					<p>The concept of AI has been around for decades, but it's only in recent years that we've seen a significant increase in its capabilities. This is due to the availability of vast amounts of data, advancements in computing power, and the development of sophisticated algorithms.
					One of the most significant developments in AI is machine learning, which involves training computer systems to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed. This has enabled AI to perform tasks that were previously thought to be impossible, such as driving cars, recognizing speech, and diagnosing diseases.</p>
					<h2> AI in everyday life</h2>
					<p class="ioio">AI is also transforming the business world. Companies are using AI to automate routine tasks, improve customer service, and make better decisions. For example, AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries, freeing up time for human employees to focus on more complex tasks.
						AI is also being used to analyze data and identify trends that might not be apparent to humans. For example, AI algorithms can analyze customer data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.</p>
					<h2> Future of AI</h2>
					<P>The future of AI is bright, with many experts predicting that it will continue to have a significant impact on our lives. However, there are also concerns about the potential risks of AI, such as job displacement, privacy invasion, and the possibility of AI systems becoming too powerful.
						To address these concerns, it's important to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. This involves ensuring that AI systems are transparent, explainable, and accountable. It also involves developing regulations and guidelines to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits society as a whole.
